## Differences From Upstream

This fork is based on the original [xitanggg/open-resume](https://github.com/xitanggg/open-resume) project and keeps the same core resume builder/parser flow. It adds a set of changes focused on Japanese/CJK resumes, richer resume sections, and reliable re-editing after export.

| **Area** | **What This Fork Adds** |
|---|---|
| **Japanese/CJK PDF Support** | Automatically uses a CJK-capable PDF font when resume content contains Japanese/CJK text, improves Japanese line wrapping, keeps Japanese punctuation such as `。` and `、` away from awkward line starts, and avoids visible hyphens at PDF wrap points. |
| **Richer Profile Links** | Supports multiple profile links instead of a single website field, so GitHub, blog, portfolio, LinkedIn, and other links can be managed separately. |
| **Work Experience Details** | Adds company URL, company description, and role summary fields, with PDF layout updates so company context, job title, dates, and links are easier to scan. |
| **Project Details** | Adds project URL and summary fields, and renders projects with the same richer structure used by work experience. |
| **Description Markdown** | Supports fixed markdown-style descriptions for headings, nested bullet lists, and links. This covers common resume text such as section blocks, sub-bullets, and reference links without turning the editor into a general markdown editor. |
| **PDF Layout & Preview** | Improves page margins, header/footer spacing, section heading page breaks, profile/contact alignment, link layout, and multi-page preview scrolling for both Letter and A4 documents. |
| **Editable Data Export** | Adds JSON data export/import alongside PDF download. The JSON file stores both resume data and settings, so exported resumes can be imported later and edited without relying on lossy PDF parsing. |

## ⚒️ Resume Builder

OpenResume's resume builder allows user to create a modern professional resume easily.

![Resume Builder Demo](https://i.ibb.co/jzcrrt8/resume-builder-demo-optimize.gif)

It has 5 Core Features:
| <div style="width:285px">**Feature**</div> | **Description** |
|---|---|
| **1. Real Time UI Update** | The resume PDF is updated in real time as you enter your resume information, so you can easily see the final output. |
| **2. Modern Professional Resume Design** | The resume PDF is a modern professional design that adheres to U.S. best practices and is ATS friendly to top ATS platforms such as Greenhouse and Lever. It automatically formats fonts, sizes, margins, bullet points to ensure consistency and avoid human errors. |
| **3. Privacy Focus** | The app only runs locally on your browser, meaning no sign up is required and no data ever leaves your browser, so it gives you peace of mind on your personal data. (Fun fact: Running only locally means the app still works even if you disconnect the internet.) |
| **4. Import From Existing Resume PDF** | If you already have an existing resume PDF, you have the option to import it directly, so you can update your resume design to a modern professional design in literally a few seconds. |
| **5. Successful Track Record** | OpenResume users have landed interviews and offers from top companies, such as Dropbox, Google, Meta to name a few. It has been proven to work and liken by recruiters and hiring managers. |

## 🔍 Resume Parser

OpenResume’s second component is the resume parser. For those who have an existing resume, the resume parser can help test and confirm its ATS readability.
